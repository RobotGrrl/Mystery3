/*

the basic idea of this is...
controlling a robot from a particle system.

different particles would represent different actions or sensors for the robot.

there would be basic constraints on the system to make sure none of the particles
stay the same way for too long. (like if they get attracted together for too long,
then more entropy or forces will be added to make them come apart.)

came up with the idea originally in april for the cloud robotics hackathon in 2013,
picking it up again now to try it out again. hmm...
